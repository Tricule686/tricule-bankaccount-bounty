Setup:
The site comprises two main sections: "Account Info" and "Actions."

•	Account Info: This section serves as an account summary, providing details about the account holder (we used "Tricule Stackup"), the account type (selected as "Savings"), and the initial balance ($1000).

•	Actions: The "Actions" section is where the action happens. Users can perform banking operations, including depositing, withdrawing, and checking their balance.

Using the Site:

Actions:
On the right side of the page, you'll find the "Actions" section. This is where you can engage in banking activities using the following options:

•	Deposit: Choose "Deposit" from the dropdown, input the desired deposit amount in the "Enter amount" field, and click "Perform Action." A successful deposit triggers a popup notification.

•	Withdraw: Opt for "Withdraw" from the dropdown, specify the withdrawal amount, and click "Perform Action." If the withdrawal is successful, a popup notification appears.

•	Check Balance: Select "Check Balance" from the dropdown and then click "Perform Action." The current account balance is displayed in the "Balance" section without alteration.

Error Handling:
Observe how the website handles errors. Attempt to deposit zero dollars or withdraw more than your balance. You'll notice error messages displayed in the "Message" section.

Styling and Design:
The website boasts an appealing design with a background color, well-structured content, and interactive hover effects.

Incorporating Classes, Switch Statements, and Try-Catch-Finally Statements:

In this website, I've skillfully employed classes, switch statements, and try-catch-finally statements to create a reliable and user-friendly experience.

Classes (BankAccount Class):
I've introduced a BankAccount class that encapsulates crucial account information like the account holder's name, account type, and balance. This class ensures organized and efficient data management within the application.

Switch Statements:
To handle user actions such as deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks, I've harnessed switch statements. These statements adeptly direct user input to the appropriate functionality within the application, ensuring seamless interaction.

Try-Catch-Finally Statements:
I've integrated try-catch-finally statements to enhance error handling and user feedback. The try block permits action execution, while the catch block gracefully manages errors by displaying informative user messages. The finally block ensures proper cleanup and readies the application for subsequent interactions, bolstering its reliability.
